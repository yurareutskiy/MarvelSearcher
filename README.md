### What can I do else.
If this project had to be finished, I would add some things. Consider this list as FIX-ME:
1. Integrate coordinator for routing and passing a data between screens.
2. Improve a connection between View and ViewModel
3. Extract all constants and organize them
4. Add error handling (catching API errors and displaing them)
5. Improve a user experience when the app is loading
6. Hide API credentials from public access (like in privite repo)
